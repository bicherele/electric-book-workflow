# The Electric Book Workflow

This workflow creates digital-first books in print, as ebooks, and for the web. We developed it for ourselves at [Electric Book Works](http://electricbookworks.com), for producing books that are largely text with some images, such as novels, non-fiction books, essays, papers, poetry, textbooks, manuals and reports.

It's a work in progress with a learning curve, but we've already used it to create high-quality books for very discerning publishers. Used well, it can completely replace InDesign for the production of book interiors.

[Read the guide](http://electricbookworks.github.io/electric-book-workflow/). As a little book, the guide is also an example of the workflow in action.
