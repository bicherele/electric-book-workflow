<h1 id="the-ebw-book-framework">The EBW book framework</h1>

<p class="first">You’re looking at a template home page for a collection of books. It’s created with the <a href="https://github.com/electricbookworks/book-framework">EBW book framework</a>. We developed the framework at <a href="http://electricbookworks.com">Electric Book Works</a> for our own publishing. With some technical expertise, you can use it, too. It lets you store books in plain text with great version control, and output various formats quickly, such as website versions, ebooks and print editions.</p>

<p>If you’re creating one or more books in a series or collection, this index page is a good place to keep information about the books, like basic metadata, licensing info, and marketing copy like blurbs. It won’t be included in the output versions of your books (e.g. the print PDF or epub), but it can be a landing page for the series if you publish a collection as a website.</p>

<p>We recommend linking to each book here, either to the index page (a clickable cover) or contents page of each book. For instance, tapping this cover will open the framework’s template book:</p>

<blockquote class="figure">
  <p><a href="book-one"><img src="book-one/images/cover.jpg" alt="Book One" /></a></p>

  <p>A little book showing default structure and typography.</p>
