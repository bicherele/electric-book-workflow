### To his Brother Quintus (in Sardinia)

*ROME, 12 FEBRUARY*{:.allsmallcaps}—I have  already told you the earlier proceedings; now let me
describe what was done afterwards:
{:.first}

* The legations were postponed from the 1st of February to the 13th. 
* On the former day our business was not brought to a settlement. 
* On the 2nd of February Milo appeared for trial. 
	*	Pompey came to support him. 
	*	Marcellus spoke on being called upon by me. 
	*	We came off with flying colours. 
*	The case was adjourned to the 7th. 

Meanwhile (in the senate), the legations having been postponed to the 13th, the
business of allotting the quaestors and furnishing the outfit of the
praetors was brought before the house. But nothing was done,
because many speeches were interposed denouncing the state of
the Republic. 

Gaius Cato published his bill for the recall of
Lentulus, whose son thereon put on mourning. On the 7th Milo
appeared. Pompey spoke, or rather wished to speak. For as soon as
he got up Clodius's ruffians raised a shout, and throughout his
whole speech he was interrupted, not only by hostile cries, but by
personal abuse and insulting remarks. *This is a sidenote using an inline span. In the markdown, note the `{:.sidenote}` tag after the closing `*`. For this sidenote to work on screen, a browser or ereader must support CSS to float the footnote correctly, or it'll appear in the text flow. For endnote-style notes, see [chapter&nbsp;1](1.html).*{:.sidenote} However, when he had
finished his speech—for he shewed great courage in these
circumstances, he was not cowed, he said all he had to say, and at
times had by his commanding presence even secured silence for
his words--well, when he had finished, up got Clodius. *Here's another sidenote, right after the last one.*{:.sidenote} Our party
received him with such a shout—for they had determined to pay
him out--that he lost all presence of mind, power of speech, or
control over his countenance. 

This went on up to two o'clock -- Pompey having finished his speech at noon -- and every kind
of abuse, and finally epigrams of the most outspoken indecency
were uttered against Clodius and Clodia. Mad and livid with rage
Clodius, in the very midst of the shouting, kept putting questions
to his claque: "Who was it who was starving the commons to
death?" His ruffians answered, "Pompey." "Who wanted to be sent
to Alexandria ?" They answered, "Pompey." "Who did they wish to
go ?" They answered, "Crassus." The latter was present at the time
with no friendly feelings to Milo. 

About three o clock, as though at
a given signal, the Clodians began spitting at our men. 

1. There was an outburst of rage. 
2. They began a movement for forcing us from our ground. 
3. Our men charged: his ruffians turned tail. 
4. Clodius was pushed off the rostra: and then we too made our escape for fear of mischief in the riot. 
5. The senate was summoned into the Curia: Pompey went home. 

However, I did not myself enter the
senate-house, lest I should be obliged either to refrain from
speaking on matters of such gravity, or in defending Pompey (for
he was being attacked by Bibulus, Curio, Favonius, and Servilius
the younger) should give offence to the loyalists.

The business was
adjourned to the next day. Clodius fixed the Quirinalia (17th of
February) for his prosecution. On the 8th the senate met in the
temple of Apollo, that Pompey might attend. Pompey made an
impressive speech. 

> That day nothing was concluded. On the 9th in
the temple of Apollo a degree passed the senate "that what had
taken place on the 7th of February was treasonable." 
>
> On this day
Cato warmly inveighed against Pompey, and throughout his speech
arraigned him as though he were at the bar. He said a great deal
about me, to my disgust, though it was in very laudatory terms.

When he attacked Pompey's perfidy to me, he was listened to in
profound silence on the part of my enemies. Pompey answered
him boldly with a palpable allusion to Crassus, and said outright
that "he would take better precautions to protect his life than
Africanus had done, whom C. Carbo had assassinated."

Accordingly, important events appear to me to be in the wind. For
Pompey understands what is going on, and imparts to me 

*	that plots are being formed against his life, 
*	that Gaius Cato is being supported by Crassus, 
*	that money is being supplied to Clodius, 
*	that both are backed by Crassus and Curio, as well as by Bibulus and
his other detractors,
*	that he must take extraordinary precautions to
prevent being overpowered by that demagogue--with a people all
but wholly alienated, a nobility hostile, a senate ill-affected, and
the younger men corrupt. 

So he is making his preparations and summoning men from the country. 

On his part, Clodius is rallying
his gangs: a body of men is being got together for the Quirinalia.
For that occasion we are considerably in a majority, owing to the
forces brought up by Pompey himself: and a large contingent is
expected from Picenum and Gallia, to enable us to throw out
Cato's bills also about Milo and Lentulus.*This is a note that on screen will appear as a sidenote, and in print will appear at the bottom of the page. To do this, add `.bottom` to the `.sidenote` tag: `{:.sidenote .bottom}`.*{:.sidenote .bottom}

On the 10th of February an indictment was lodged against Sestius
for bribery by the informer Cn. Nerius, of the Pupinian tribe, arid
on the same day by a certain M. Tullius for riot. He was ill. I went
at once, as I was bound to do. to his house, and put myself wholly
at his service: and that was more than people expected, who
thought that I had good cause for being angry with him. The result
is that my extreme kindness and grateful disposition are made
manifest both to Sestius himself and to all the world, and I shall be
as good as my word. But this same informer Nerius also named
Cn. Lentulus Vatia and C. Cornelius to the commissioners. On the
same day a decree passed the senate "that political clubs and
associations should be broken up, and that a law in regard to them
should be brought in, enacting that those who did not break off
from them should be liable to the same penalty as those convicted
of riot."

On the 10th of February I spoke in defence of Bestia on a charge of
bribery before the praetor Cn. Domitius, in the middle of the
forum and in a very crowded court; and in the course of my speech
I came to the incident of Sestius, after receiving many wounds in
the temple of Castor, having been preserved by the aid of Bestia.
Here I took occasion to pave the way beforehand for a refutation of
the charges which are being got up against Sestius, and I passed a
well-deserved encomium upon him with the cordial approval of
everybody. He was himself very much delighted with it. I tell you
this because you have often advised me in your letters to retain the
friendship of Sestius. 

Sestius
:	This is an example of definition-list typography. Publius Sestius was a Roman senator in the 1st century BC. He was a praetor in 53 BC, as well as a friend and ally of Cicero, by whom he was defended in 56 BC. Upon the outbreak of Caesar's Civil War he joined the party of Pompey, having become the governor of Cilicia. According to Plutarch's Life of Brutus he was accompanied by Marcus Brutus to his province, but Sestius subsequently went over to Caesar, who sent him into Cappadocia in 48 BC.

This is I am writing this on the 12th of February
before daybreak; the day on which I am to dine with Pomponius on
the occasion of his wedding.

Our position in other respects is such as you used to cheer my
despondency by telling me it would be--one of great dignity and
popularity: this is a return to old times for you and me effected, my
brother, by your patience, high character, loyalty, and, I may also
add, your conciliatory manners. The house of Licinius, near the
grove of Piso, has been taken for you. But, as I hope, in a few
months time, after the 1st of July, you will move into your own.

Some excellent tenants, the Lamiae, have taken your house in
Carinie. I have received no letter from you since the one dated
Olbia. I am anxious to hear how you are and what you find to
amuse you, but above all to see you yourself as soon as possible.
Take care of your health, my dear brother, and though it is winter
time, yet reflect that after all it is Sardinia that you are in.

## Some poetry

Have a look at the underlying markdown here to see how we store poetry. You have two options, demonstrated on the first and second stanzas from *Hamlet* below. 

1. In the markdown, create a line break by adding two spaces at the end of a line. Then add `{:.verse}` after each stanza. This creates semantically correct poetry, with each stanza an HTML paragraph, and the lines separated by line-breaks. However, the ends of lines that run over (e.g. long lines or lines on small screens that wrap) will not be indented as poetry should be. This is a limitation of CSS.
2. In the markdown, put `* ` before each line, to make each stanza an HTML list. Then, again, add `{:.verse}` after each stanza. Technically, a poem stanza should not be structured as a list – it's semantically frowned upon – but it gives you greater control over each line, and makes it possible to correctly indent runover lines.

To be, or not to be, that    is the question:  
Whether 'tis Nobler in the mind to suffer  
The Slings and Arrows of outrageous Fortune,  
Or to take Arms against a Sea of troubles,  
And by opposing end them: to die, to sleep  
No more; and by a sleep, to say we end  
The Heart-ache, and the thousand Natural shocks  
That Flesh is heir to? 'Tis a consummation  
Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep,  
To sleep, perchance to Dream; aye, there's the rub,  
For in that sleep of death, what dreams may come,  
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,  
Must give us pause. There's the respect  
That makes Calamity of so long life:  
For who would bear the Whips and Scorns of time,  
The Oppressor's wrong, the proud *poor*{:.sidenote} man's Contumely,   
The pangs of despised *disprized*{:.sidenote} Love, the Law’s delay,  
The insolence of Office, and the Spurns  
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,  
When he himself might his Quietus make  
With a bare Bodkin? Who would Fardels *these Fardels*{:.sidenote} bear,  
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,  
But that the dread of something after death,  
The undiscovered Country, from whose bourn  
No Traveller returns, Puzzles the will,  
And makes us rather bear those ills we have,  
Than fly to others that we know not of.  
{:.verse}

* Thus Conscience does make Cowards of us all,
* And thus the Native hue of Resolution
* Is sicklied o'er, with the pale cast of Thought,
* And enterprises of great pitch *pith*{:.sidenote} and moment,
* With this regard their Currents turn awry, *away*{:.sidenote}
* And lose the name of Action. Soft you now,
* The fair Ophelia? Nymph, in thy Orisons
* Be all my sins remembered.
