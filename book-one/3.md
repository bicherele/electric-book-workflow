# Editing for reflowable text

This assumes you're working in markdown for the EBW.

## Editorial issues

*	Prevent ellipses falling after a line break: control in markdown by using a non-breaking space (`&nbsp;`) before the ellipsis.
*	Prevet dashes after a line break: control in markdown by using a non-breaking space (`&nbsp;`) before the dash:
	*	`the en-dash&nbsp;– as I've explained&nbsp;– is tricky to use correctly.`
*	Prevent line breaks inside big numbers (e.g. 40 000) between numbers and units (e.g. 3 pm, 24 May) or adjectives and their units (e.g. Grade 2): control in markdown by using a non-breaking space (`&nbsp;`) in the space:
	*	`40&nbsp;000`
	*	`3&nbsp;pm`
	*	`Grade&nbsp;2`

## Designer's styling issues

Para that ends with a single word: control with letter-spacing (i.e. `{:.tight}` and `{:.loose}` tags)

When hyphenating manually, always use discretionary hyphens. Use the HTML entity `&shy;`.
