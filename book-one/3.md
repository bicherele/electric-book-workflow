# Editing for the EBW Book Framework

For many books, we use a super-efficient workflow for editing and laying out books. It's called the EBW Book Framework. This guide explains how to edit a manuscript for the framework. If you get it right, we can zap out an almost-print-ready PDF, website or ebook from your files in a matter of minutes. That is, there's no typesetting! 

To edit for the framework, you need to have a rough idea how HTML works, and you need to learn markdown. This is much, much easier than you think.

## How HTML works

HTML is a computer language that humans can read. In HTML, each piece of content (e.g. a paragraph) starts and ends with a tag a computer can recognise. Tags are always in elbow brackets, like this paragraph tag: `<p>`. And if I want to tell the computer what *kind* of paragraph is it, say it's a blurb, I can put it in a class like this: `<p class="blurb">`. The `<p>` tag is one of about a hundred tags in HTML, maybe ten of which you'll only ever see in a book. Class names are infinite, because we can make them up as we need them.

HTML is very simple and very powerful. We can mark up everything in a book using these tags and classes. In our framework, we aim to store each book in HTML, with each book part (title page, contents page, chapter, etc.) in its own file.

To create PDFs and ebooks, we combine that HTML with a CSS stylesheet. CSS is another computer language that defines design: font sizes, indentation, colour, etc. So if we combine a book's HTML with a print stylesheet, we can get a print-ready PDF. If we combine the same HTML with a web stylesheet, we get the book as a website. (We've pre-designed a few default stylesheets already.)

Now HTML is very, very time consuming to write by hand. So we have a shortcut! it's called markdown, and it's amazing.

## How markdown works

Markdown is just plain text, neatly structured. Plain text as in `.txt` files. It's so neatly structured that software can work out, just from its structure, what HTML you intended, and convert it instantly to finished HTML, tags and all. No way! Yes way.

Markdown was invented by two very smart, very lucky people: John Gruber and Aaron Swartz. Since their work, others have added some features to it. So there are many variations of markdown today. We use one called kramdown.

As you work with markdown, you'll get to know it really well. That can take as little as a few hours. And hopefully you'll come to love it as much as we do. To do that, you'll need to keep the kramdown syntax reference handy. For now, though, we'll explain the most common, important things you'll to edit most simple books.

### Paragraphs

This is easy: a paragraph is lines of text separated from any other text by an empty line.

### Headings

You can use up to six levels of heading, from level one to level six. To make a heading, just put one or more has signs, `#`, and a space, before the heading. Like with paragraphs, separate the heading from everything else with an empty line space.

```
## This is a second-level heading

This is a paragraph.
```

### Italics

Just put `*` before and after the italicised words: `it really is *this* easy`.

### Bold

Just put two `*`s before and after the bold text: `good for **shouting**`.

Tip: If you use bold in a first-level heading (e.g. `# **Chapter 1** Lost at Sea`), our default typography will put that bold text onto its own line, set off from the heading. This is useful for chapter numbers that should look separate from the chapter title, but in the underlying HTML need to be part of the heading, for instance when software generates tables of contents.

### Lists

There are two kinds of lists: bulleted and numbered. For a bulleted list, start each line with a `*` and a tab. For a numbered list, start each line with a number, a full stop and a tab (you can use any number, because the software will always create an HTML list that starts with 1; but it's best to use 1 or the actual numbers you intend, just to make things neat).

```
1.	Apples
2.	Oranges
3.	Pears

*	Apples
*	Oranges
*	Pears
```

### Simple tables

You can create simple tables in markdown. You can make them really neat, or you can make them really efficient:

```
| Fruit   | Quantity |
|---------|----------|
| Apples  | 2        |
| Oranges | 5        |
| Pears   | 0        |

| Fruit | Quantity
|--
| Apples | 2
| Oranges | 5
| Pears | 0
```

(To make more complex tables with merged or individually styled cells, you have to use actual HTML table markup. Ergh. That's for another time)

### Blockquotes

Remember old email programs, that put a `>` at the start of each line when you hit 'Reply'? Ah, `>` means blockquote. Start each line with `>` and a space to make text a blockquote.

We use blockquotes for more than just quotations, though. We'll come back to this later.

### Hyperlinks

If you want your final HTML to include a clickable link:

*	surround the text you want clickable with `[` and `]`
*	put the URL it should point to between `(` and `)` immediately afterwards.

```
To learn more, [click here](http://google.com).
```

### Images

To place an image, you include a line telling the computer where to find the image file. This looks like a hyperlink, but with a `!` at the start of the line. Inside the square brackets, you include a brief description of the image (this is useful to screen readers for the visually impaired).

```
![A dog chasing a bus.](images/dogbus.jpg)
```

In the parentheses above, the `images/` part says that the `dogbus.jpg` image is in the `images` folder, which is alongside the markdown file. In our framework, we always put images in the `images` folder like this.

### Endnotes

Endnotes in our framework appear at the end of a document (that is, a web page or a book chapter). 

*	put a `[^1]` where the footnote reference should appear (the `1` there can be any numbers or letters, and should be different for each footnote in a document);
*	anywhere in the document (we recommend after the paragraph containing the footnote reference), put `[^1]: Your footnote text here.`.

We'll explain how to create notes on the side or bottom of a page (footnotes) later when we talk about classes.

Note: In kramdown syntax, unfortunately, endnotes are called footnotes; so it's easy to confuse them. In book parlance, there is a big difference between footnotes and endnotes.
{:.box}

### Definition lists

A definition list is a list of definitions, not surprisingly. Think of a dictionary. A definition list comprises one or more entries, and each entry has a headword and a definition. Even if you're not editing a dictionary, you might need to create a short glossary or define a word or two at some point. To create a definition entry in markdown, put the headword on its own line, and the definition on the next, after a colon and a tab:

```
Editor
:	Someone who spends more time learning new tricks than making money.
```

To create a whole list of definition entries, just put one of these after the other, with a line space between them.

## Using class tags

We're going to get a bit more advanced now. Get a cup of tea. 

As we mentioned earlier, sometimes we have to tell our software what *kind* of paragraph or list or blockquote we want. These *kinds* of text are called *classes*. To give something a class, we add a kramdown tag in curly braces, with a colon, and a dot before the class name.

```
This paragraph should be in a box.
{:.box}
```

For the resulting HTML to actually appear in a box, when we turn your markdown into a finished book, we'll have to combine it with a CSS stylesheet that includes formatting instructions for the `box` class. If you're just editing in markdown, you don't have to think about the stylesheets. Our EBW book framework's default stylesheets include instructions for `box` as well as several other classes. (Which we'll list in a moment.)

But if your book needs classes that aren't already in our framework's stylesheets, you'll need to ask a CSS-savvy designer to write you some CSS instructions for your new class, and to [put these in a child stylesheet](https://github.com/electricbookworks/book-framework#stylesheets).

Note: if you invent new classes, make sure you name them for their semantic *purpose*, not their appearance. For instance, `important-tip` is a better class name than `shaded-bold`. Also, class names should always be lowercase and have no spaces.
{:.box}

In addition to boxes, our default stylesheets include lots of other classes for common book features.

Note: Classes can be applied to two kinds of element: block elements and inline elements. A block element is anything with a line break before and after it, like a paragraph or a list. An inline element is anything that appears inside a line of running text, like bold and italic. Most of our pre-designed classes are for either block or inline elements, and sometimes both. Usually, when applying our classes to inline elements, surround the text you're tagging with asterisks (`*`) as you would italics, and put your tag immediately after the closing `*`, on the same line (e.g. `*This is a sidenote*{:.sidenote}`).
