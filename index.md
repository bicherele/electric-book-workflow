# The Electric Book Workflow

[![The Electric Book Workflow guide](guide/images/cover-thumb.jpg)](guide) The [Electric Book Workflow](https://github.com/electricbookworks/electric-book-workflow) is a set of tools and processes for creating high-quality books with (mostly) free, open technologies. We developed it at [Electric Book Works](http://electricbookworks.com) for our own publishing. It allows you to store books in plain text with great version control, and to output website versions, ebooks and print editions easily from a single source. With some technical expertise, you can implement it, too. 

This guide is created with the workflow. Read it here, or download [the PDF](download/ebw-electric-book-workflow-guide.pdf) or [EPUB](download/ebw-electric-book-workflow-guide.epub) versions.
