# The EBW book framework

You're looking at a template home page for a collection of books. It's created with our open-source [EBW book framework](https://github.com/electricbookworks/book-framework). We developed the framework at [Electric Book Works](http://electricbookworks.com) for our own publishing. It lets you store books in plain text with great version control, and output various formats quickly, such as website versions, ebooks and print editions.

With some technical expertise, you can use it, too. You can also [hire us](http://electricbookworks.com) to make your books, ebooks and web-books for you. See [the template in action as a website](book-one), or [download a PDF version](download/ebw-book-framework-template.pdf).

All the books in a collection (and therefore gathered on one site) can share the same web design (CSS), but they can also have their own styles instead or in addition. For instance, [here's the same book](book-two) with a different nav bar.

If you're creating one or more books in a series or collection, this index page is a good place to keep information about the books, like basic metadata, licensing info, and marketing copy like blurbs. It won't be included in the output versions of your books (e.g. the print PDF or epub), but it can be a landing page for the series if you publish a collection as a website.
