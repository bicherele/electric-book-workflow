# This is a template

You're looking at the template index page for a collection of books. It's created with the [Electric Book Works](http://electricbookworks.com) markdown-based [book framework](https://github.com/electricbookworks/book-framework). 
{:.first}

If you're creating one or more books in a series or collection, this index page is a good place to keep information about the books, like basic metadata, licensing info, and marketing copy like blurbs. It won't be included in the output versions of your books (e.g. the print PDF or epub), but it can be a landing page for the series if you publish a collection as a website.

We recommend linking here to the contents page of each book, like this for instance:

* [Book One](book-one/0-3-contents.html)
