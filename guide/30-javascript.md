# Using Javascript

Wherever possible, we like to create books without Javascript. Printing and ebooks is simpler without it, and it can quickly bloat websites. That said, if you need to use Javascript, place scripts in the series `js` folder. 

If you use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) (perhaps with [browserify](http://browserify.org/)), the default `_config.yml` will exclude `node_modules` from Jekyll.
